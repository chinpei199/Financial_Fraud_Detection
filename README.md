# Financial_Fraud_Detection
Predictive model to detect fraud in financial transaction

## Introduction
This project aims to develop a classification model to detect financial fraud transactions using machine learning techniques. We apply and compare Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost models to classify potentially fraudulent financial activity based on structured data. 

## Project Objective
- To investigate and preprocess online transaction data to discover significant indicators of fraudulent activity.
- To develop and apply machine learning models that are capable to detect fraudulent transactions with strong classification performance.
- To compare and evaluate the efficiency of different fraud detection algorithms based on performance metrics.
